// Create a conditional statement that compares two numbers.
// You can choose if those numbers will be equal ==, less than <,
// greater than >, less than or equal to <=, or greater than or
// equal to >= each other. Include an if, else if, and else statement.
// Create an alert() that gives feedback based on the number.
// Test your statement with different numbers to make sure all alerts work.
